My first respository

Hello everybody!

My name is Mike and im a drop out that wants to get back into the field and starting doing what ive always wanted to. My goal is to get into backend dev ops and ultimately become a network analyst or network administrator.  I enjoy video games and all kinds of music, especialy heavy metal and rock.
